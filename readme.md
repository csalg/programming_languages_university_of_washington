Veredict: I loved everything about this course. 

Pros
* Dan Grossman explains everything simply and concisely, yet deeply so that you get a full understanding of what the programming language does when it interprets your code. 
* Problems to motivate discussion are presented, usually followed by several different solutions (idioms) and coherent arguments for which one is the most suitable. The homework problems are not too hard, at least not unnecessarily so, but give you enough practice so that you get muscle memory in the language and the concepts discussed in class stick.
* This course makes you a better coder (unless you've already covered the material elsewhere, obviously). 
* Finally, I wasn't very keen on learning SML initially because I'd never heard of this non-mainstream functional language. It's very similar to LISP in how you would code for it, but it is a statically typed language, whereas LISP is dynamically typed. This has several advantages which the language does a great job of exploiting: one of those advantages is speed (being statically typed it compiles down to code that runs almost as fast as compiled C code), another one is the ability to check more thoroughly for correctness, one last one is pattern matching (killer feature IMO). Lastly, OCAML, SML's sibling, has quite a few modules, so I'll probably build something with it in the future, like a fast backend or something.

Cons:
* None, I wish every single CS course was like this one. For me this course is perfect.
